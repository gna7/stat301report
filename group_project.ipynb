    "## Introduction\n",
    "In recent years, the assessment of higher education institutions has garnered significant attention due to the implications for students, educators, policymakers, and the academic community at large. University rankings serve as a vital tool for students seeking quality education, researchers exploring collaborative opportunities, and institutions striving for excellence in teaching and research. Understanding the factors influencing these rankings is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance educational outcomes.\n",
    "The evaluation of universities encompasses various dimensions, including teaching quality, research output, international outlook, and citations impact. While these dimensions are well-established in the academic landscape, the interplay between them and their impact on university rankings remain subjects of exploration and debate. Consequently, researchers have sought to delve deeper into the relationships between these factors to uncover insights that could inform institutional strategies and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research has shed light on the multifaceted nature of university rankings and the factors influencing them. For instance, Smith et al. (2018) explored the relationship between teaching quality and research productivity, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach in academic institutions. Similarly, Jones and Wang (2020) investigated the impact of gender diversity on research outcomes, emphasizing the need for inclusive policies to promote innovation and excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "By building upon the findings of existing studies, our research aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding university rankings and shed light on the intricate dynamics shaping academic performance.\n",

    "#### Research Question \n",
    "In this study, we aim to investigate how specific variables affect the research score of universities, as indicated in the World University Rankings 2023 dataset. Our primary research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"How does a university's research score change based on its rank, teaching score, and female to male student ratio?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these questions, we utilize the [World University Rankings 2023 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alitaqi000/world-university-rankings-2023), sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of data from 1799 universities across 104 countries and regions. Compiled by Times Higher Education, the dataset incorporates survey responses from 40,000 scholars worldwide and analyzes 121 million citations from over 15.5 million research publications. With over 2,500 institutions contributing data, the dataset comprises over 680,000 data points, providing a rich source for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key variables within the dataset include university rank, teaching score, research score, citations score, and the female-to-male student ratio, among others. These variables offer insights into various aspects of university performance and enable us to examine the relationships between teaching, research, and gender diversity. In all, we have 13 different variables and 2341 observations (including NAs). The variables are:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Variable | Variable Type | Description |\n",
    "|---| -------- | ------- | --- |\n",
    "|1| University rank  | chr  |Rank of specific university all over the world|\n",

    "|7| Female : male ratio |chr  |A ratio of female to male students respectively|\n",
    "|8| Overall score | chr | The combined weighted scores of those given below. Out of 100|\n",
    "|9| Teaching score | chr |The percieved prestige of the institution based on the Academic Reputation Survey. Out of 100.|\n",
    "|10| Research score | chr |Reputation for research excellence amongst peers based on the Academic Reputation Survey. Out of 100|\n",
    "|11| Citations score | chr |The number of citations received by a journal in one year to documents published in the three previous years, divided by the number of documents indexed in Scopus published in those same three years. Out of 100.|\n",
    "|12| Industry income score | chr |How much money a university receives from the working industry in exchange for its academic expertise. Out of 100|\n",
    "|13| International outlook score | chr |The ability of a university to attract undergraduates, postgraduates and faculty from all over the globe.|"
